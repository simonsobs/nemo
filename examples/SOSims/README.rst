.. note::  This tutorial is probably out of date, and should be
           replaced with a guide on how to run **Nemo** on the
           mission-scale simulations. Some of the tools
           mentioned in here may still be useful though.

The `examples/SOSims <https://github.com/simonsobs/nemo/tree/main/examples/SOSims>`_
directory contains scripts for working with
the simulated Simons Observatory maps made by the 
`Map-Based Simulation Pipeline Working Group <https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations>`_.
More tools for handling the simulated maps may be available elsewhere,
but here you should be able to find enough to get you going with 
running Nemo on them.

Making multi-component simulated maps
=====================================

The map-based simulations are provided in HEALPix format, with one map 
for each component (CMB, CIB, tSZ, noise etc.) at each frequency. The 
``combineComponentMaps.py`` script can be used to add these
together. To use this, you will first have to download the needed 
`simulation maps <https://github.com/simonsobs/map_based_simulations>`_ and 
edit ``healpixSimsDir`` in the script to point to the directory where 
these can be found. You can then simply run this script with:

.. code-block::

   python combineComponentMaps.py

As provided, this script will make combined maps at four frequencies
(93, 145, 225, 280 GHz) featuring CMB, CIB, tSZ, and noise.

Making CAR projection maps
==========================

Nemo runs on FITS images that have a valid World 
Coordinate System (WCS) in the header. For Simons Observatory, these
use the plate carr√©e (CAR) projection. However, the map-based 
simulations are currently provided in HEALPix format. The 
``healpix2CAR.py`` script (a modified version of a script by
Mathew Madhavacheril taken from the `TILe-C <https://github.com/ACTCollaboration/tile-c>`_
package) can be used to re-project these to CAR. Look at the 
``HEALPIX_TO_CAR.sh`` script to see examples of its use.

As one of its inputs, the ``healpix2CAR.py`` takes a plain-text file 
containing the desired output image header. This defines both the sky 
area and the pixel scale. There are a few examples provided:


* ``template_small.txt``\ : Corresponds to a subsection of the ACT D56 field. 
* ``template_E-D56.txt``\ : Contains the full ACTPol E-D56 field footprint.
* ``template_AdvACT.txt``\ : The pixelization used for AdvACT maps. To use Nemo on very large maps (as in ``template_AdvACT.txt``\ ), you will need to set-up the configuration file to break the map into tiles (see below).

If you look at the ``HEALPIX_TO_CAR.sh`` script, you will see that it uses an option
to add a small amount of additional white noise to the output CAR maps. 
This is currently being used to avoid the effect of ringing in the CAR maps 
(which arises because the HEALPix maps are lower resolution than the output
CAR maps - when NSIDE = 8192 maps are available, this may not be a problem).
With the additional white noise, the matched-filtered maps made by Nemo from
these simulations look okay when viewed with, e.g., 
`DS9 <http://ds9.si.edu/site/Home.html>`_.

Making beam files
=================

Nemo understands beams given in a simple plain-text format, as used by
ACT. For the map-based simulations, Gaussian beams are used with FHWM
set according to the values given in Table 1 of the 
`Simons Observatory: Science Goals and Forecasts <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019JCAP...02..056A/abstract>`_ 
paper. To generate the necessary beam files, run:

.. code-block::

   MAKE_BEAMS.sh

which in turn calls the ``makeGaussianBeam.py`` script.

Running Nemo on small maps
==========================

After running the above scripts, you should now have a directory that contains
CAR-projected maps (e.g., ``TOnly_la093_CAR.fits``\ , ``TOnly_la_093_small_CAR.fits``\ ,
etc.) and beam files (e.g., ``beam_gaussian_la093.txt``\ ). Various configuration 
files are provided that you can use to produce matched-filtered maps and catalogs 
using Nemo - the one that seems to work the best currently uses only 
three frequencies (93, 145, 225 GHz). You can run this with:

.. code-block::

   nemo MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small.yml

After this finishes, you will find matched-filtered maps under 
``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small/filteredMaps/``\ , while 
``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small/MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small_optimalCatalog.fits`` contains the 
candidate cluster catalog. Note that this config file filters the maps at only 
one scale - you can filter at multiple scales by uncommenting the entries under
``mapFilters`` in ``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small.yml``.

A configuration file is also supplied for running Nemo on the nominal full
SO survey footprint, by breaking the map into tiles (see below).

Extracting the survey mass limit
================================

If the ``calcSelFn`` parameter set to ``True`` in the Nemo configuration file, 
or if ``nemo`` is run using the ``-S`` switch, the main ``nemo`` script will 
calculate and output estimates of the 90% mass 
completeness threshold at some user-set signal-to-noise level (e.g., S/N > 5). 
You will find various plots related to the survey completeness as a 
function of redshift under ``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small/diagnostics/``\ , including a
mass-limit map. These estimates are subject to the assumed scaling relation 
parameters defined in the configuration file. 

If necessary, you can re-run this part using the ``nemoSelFn`` script:

.. code-block::

   nemoSelFn MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small.yml

The limits within the footprints of other surveys that intersect with the 
filtered maps can be obtained by supplying survey mask files in the 
``selFnFootprints`` parameter in the configuration file (these are commented out
in ``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small.yml``\ ). 

Running Nemo on large maps
==========================

To do this, you will first need to output large area CAR maps using (for example)
the ``healpix2CAR.py`` script with ``template_AdvACT.txt`` (just running 
``HEALPIX_TO_CAR.sh`` will do this). You will then need to use a config file that
tells Nemo how to break the map up into tiles, such as the supplied 
``MFMF_SOSims_3freq_tiles.yml``. The parameters that control the tiling used can
be found at the end of this file. In this case, the automatic tiling algorithm
will attempt to make tiles that cover 10 x 5 degrees on the sky, with a 1 
degree overlap between the tiles. 

The tiling algorithm makes use of a "survey mask", which defines the region 
that Nemo will search for clusters (or sources). The script 
``createSurveyMask.py`` generates the survey mask FITS image, taking as input
a DS9 region file containing polygon-shaped regions (see 
``surveyMask.reg``\ ), and a plain-text file that defines the image header
(\ ``template_AdvACT.txt``\ ). You can run this with:

.. code-block::

   python createSurveyMask.py template_AdvACT.txt surveyMask.reg

This writes the output survey mask to ``surveyMask.fits``. You will need this 
file to run Nemo using the included ``MFMF_SOSims_3freq_tiles.yml`` configuration.

You can run Nemo in parallel using, e.g.,

.. code-block::

   mpiexec -np $NUM_PROCESSES nemo MFMF_SOSim_3freq_tiles.yml -M

replacing ``$NUM_PROCESSES`` with the number of cores you want to run on. Nemo
will divide up the tiles between processors as evenly as it can. The file 
``slurm_nemo.sh`` shows how Nemo can be run on a cluster that uses the 
`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html>`_ job scheduler.

Using the input simulation catalogs
===================================

The halo catalog for the `WebSky <https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/index.php/WebSky_Extragalactic_CMB_Mocks>`_ 
simulations is 33 Gb in size. You can 
obtain a smaller version (28 Mb; just containing halos more massive than 
10\ :raw-html-m2r:`<sup>14</sup>` MSun), using

.. code-block::

   wget https://acru.ukzn.ac.za/~mjh/halos.fits https://acru.ukzn.ac.za/~mjh/halos.reg

(this fetches a DS9 region file as well). These were produced using ``readWebSkyInputCatalog.py`` (which is a 
modified version of the WebSky `readhalos.py <https://mocks.cita.utoronto.ca/data/websky/v0.0/readhalos.py>`_
script).

The ``nemoMass`` script can be used to obtain mass estimates for cluster candidates, but
requires a table of redshifts to match against (by object name - at least for the moment).
To produce the ``redshifts.fits`` catalog referred to by the ``MFMF_SOSims_3freq_tiles.yml``
configuration file, you can run this,

.. code-block::

   python makeRedshiftsCatalog.py MFMF_SOSim_3freq_tiles/MFMF_SOSim_3freq_tiles_optimalCatalog.fits halos.fits

You will then be able to run ``nemoMass`` with:

.. code-block::

   mpiexec -np $NUM_PROCESSES nemoMass MFMF_SOSim_3freq_tiles.yml -M

again, replacing ``$NUM_PROCESSES`` with the number of cores you want to run on. The 
``slurm_mass.sh`` scripts shows to run this using `Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html>`_ 
(this takes less than 3 minutes for a catalog of ~30,000 clusters with the settings given).

Note that the cosmological and scaling relation parameters set in the  ``massOptions`` section of
both of the example configuration files given here (\ ``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_tiles.yml`` and 
``MFMF_SOSim_3freq_small.yml``\ ) have been set to approximately reproduce those
used in the WebSky simulations.
