.. note::  This is a placeholder for now.

Here we provide a guide to reproducing the ACT DR6 cluster search
data products, as described in the ACT DR6 cluster catalog paper.

.. note::  The config files and scripts needed for this tutorial can be
           found in the `examples/ACT-DR6-clusters <https://github.com/simonsobs/nemo/tree/main/examples/ACT-DR5-clusters>`_
           directory of the **Nemo** source distribution.
